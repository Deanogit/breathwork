Personally I have found great value in practising breath exercises, to help calm my mind, reset my focus, better deal with stress and encourage deep relaxation. By practising these exercised I have found a number of tools that I can use to change my physical and mental state in times of anxiety, stress and loss of focus.

This app is inspired by the breathe exercises found on Balance [link].
